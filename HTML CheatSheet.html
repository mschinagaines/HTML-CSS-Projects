            <h1>HTML CheatSheet</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p>HTML is not a programming language. It is a mark-up language that tells web browsers how to structure the web pages that you visit. HTML consists of a series of <u>elements</u> which are wrapped in <u>tags</u>.</p>
            
            <h3>The Anatomy of An Element</h3>
            
            <!-- Insert an Example of Code -->

            <!-- Tag Example -->
            <p>(&lt;p&gt;). This is an example of a tag. It consists of the name of the element (this one being called paragraph). It marks where the element begins and ends. The ending tag includes a /.</p>

            <!-- Content Example -->
            <p> the content. This is the content of the element. In this example, the content is the text 'My Cat is Happy.'.</p>
            
            <p class="bold">The &lt;tag&gt; is combined with the content to create an element.</p>

            <!-- Aspects of Elements-->
            <h2>Aspects of Elements</h2>

            <p>Nesting Elements: Elements can be placed within other elements and this is called 'nesting'.</p>
            
            <p>An example is:</p>
            <p>&ltp&gt My Cat Is &ltstrong&gt <span class="bold">Very</span> &lt/strong&gt Happy.&lt/p&gt</p>

            <p>Block-Level Versus Inline-Level Elemts:</p>
            <p>A block-level element forms a new block on the page while an inline-level element does not.</p>
