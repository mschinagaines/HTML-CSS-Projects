                Early April and there’s a light-footed feel.<br>
                Nothing troubles from the darkened underbrush,<br>
                and the sun’s late beauty daubs <br>
                the green wood with yellows.<br>

                As if for you, a thrush rills, blue pieces of silver<br>
                that will dry like watermarks. Almost delicate,<br>
                the hour around seven, a blown-glass bowl,<br>
                edgeless and honed, made bespoke.<br>

                Yet somewhere inside this evening hour,<br>
                a man refutes: his fist<br>
                will not burden the kitchen table.<br>
                A wintered heart, hard as a knot of holly.<br>
            </span>
